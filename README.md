# Day-Planner

This simple calendar application allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. It runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

It displays standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). Each time slot represents one hour and contains the following: the time, a field to hold user input, and a save button.

Clicking on the save button will store the time and user input in localStorage.

At the top of the calendar, it displays the current day. Additionally, each hour is color coded to reflect whether the time slot is in the past, the present, or the future, and will change depending on the time of day.
